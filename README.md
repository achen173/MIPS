# MIPS

**Objective:**  Understand Assembly Language and its environment

***Project 1:***  Finding Prime Numbers in a stack by looking at each word address, loading it into registers, and finally storing it in a different stack - [More Info](https://github.com/achen173/MIPS-Assembly-Language/blob/master/Project1_PrimeNumber/AlanChen_Project1_Report.pdf)

***Project 2:*** 
 - Learn weights for a linear regression function that predicts the performance of a processor based on empirical data 
 - Use learned weights in an MIPS assembly program to perform matrix multiplication on a matrix of test data 
 - Perform cache simulations to understand cache performance across different cache architectures
